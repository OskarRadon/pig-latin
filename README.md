# Pig Latin App

#### Epicodus week 3 project, 1/20/16

#### By Chris Young and Oskar Radon

## Description

Write a Pig Latin translator or should we say an "igPay atinLay anslatorTray".

Here are the rules of Pig Latin that you should use:

For words that start with a vowel, add "ay" to the end.
For words that start with one or more consonants, move all of the first consecutive consonants to the end and add "ay". (If the first consonants include "qu", move the "u" along with the "q". Don't forget about words like "squeal" where the "qu" doesn't come first!)
For words that start with "y", treat the "y" as a consonant.
Remember to break this down into small tests and do testing and coding one behavior at a time. When you get to consonants, don't try to solve it all at once. Instead, start with an example of a word that only has one consonant; then a word with two consonants; then a word with three; and then tackle "qu" and "y".

The .slice() method for strings may come in handy.

Once you have it working for one word, get it working for sentences.
